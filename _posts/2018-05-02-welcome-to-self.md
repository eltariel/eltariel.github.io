*Haley, day 1*

So this is finally happening. I was starting to wonder if this scholarship that the Hux urged me to sign up for was going to just be money for nothing (which would have been welcome). Instead, today he didn't show up for his regular lecture, one of the other faculty members told us he'd been held up with another commitment and would be running lectures in his place until further notice. I didn't get to see if she was anywhere near as good a lecturer as the Hux though, because I was pulled aside at the door by a couple of guys with a military bearing (which they tossed back and forth) who wanted to talk to me about "the other part" of my scholarship...

I ended up in the back of a black van with a bunch of other scholarship students. Doing my best not to freak out. Occasionally I manage to hide all that anxiety well enough that I can fit in anywhere; lucky for me this was one of those times. Still feel like exploding inside though. We were an odd collection of people. I'm still having a hard time understanding why we're all on the same scholarship. Hayden seems just as weirded out right now as I'm feeling, Hilde appears to be some kind of internet celebrity wannabe with a god complex and a big mouth, Mike's a mature-age student who seems to be imperturbably calm, and Solveig is perpetually amused by literally everything. Also FREAKING TALL, even by my standards. None of us know where we're going. Except maybe Solveig. This is a little disconcerting.

Ok, fuck. Turns out that my scholarship is funded by some oddball paramilitary organisation called SELF and we're in their base now. Apparently there's an away team that's stopped responding to comms and for some reason the crack team they're planning to send in to retrieve them is... us?! Also, the Hux is the team's medic which is why he wasn't there for lectures, and at least if he's there then they'll all be in one piece. Unless he's broken too... Fuck. I'm not sure I've got any more words for this.

And then they show us how we're going to go find this team. It's basically a freaking STARGATE. I'm... nope. But I'm in this far now. Not really any way to go other than through. I'll try to keep writing this when I can, but I'm pretty sure things are going to get rather hectic now...
