Look what showed up today while I was at work!

I got home and unpacked everything excitedly and then... went and had a nap.
Today was exhasting. Then things happened around the house, and I ended up
getting back to it all around 10pm... I plugged it all together and now it
looks like this:

Currently still working on getting the basics set up. It's a regular install
of Raspbian Buster Lite, with the libraries for the sensors installed from
[Pimoroni's enviroplus repo in github][enviroplus]. I'm going to make
sure the sample scripts work, then I'm heading to bed. Tomorrow I'll wander
over to [SparkCC](sparkcc) and either build an enclosure for it, or do
something completely unrelated. Not sure which is more likely at the moment.
