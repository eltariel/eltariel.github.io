Today the first couple of things showed up for my air quality monitor. Shame they're
the boring bits... we've all seen a raspi zero before. Except of course the WH variant
was sold out everywhere I looked, so I ended up with a plain W and a separate header
to solder on by myself. Good thing [SparkCC][sparkcc] is open tonight!

This wouldn't have been the first time I've been so uncoordinated I destroyed something
with a soldering iron.

Apparently tonight wasn't destruction night though, so now I have a zero with a header
attached and it *actually works*. It's... not the prettiest thing in the world though.
And without the SD card or the sensors, it's not much of a monitoring station yet.

One step at a time?
