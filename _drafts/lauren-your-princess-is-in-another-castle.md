We watched Haley disappear back toward the basecamp with Daniel, then busied ourselves planning what the hell we were going to do next. Seemed like the obvious objective was the tower, but we didn't really have a plan for what we were going to do when we got there. Other than rescue Margaret, anyway. It was only about an hour's hike to the tower from where the hovercraft-shaped lump of uselessness sat, but we figured that would be enough time to think of something. Besides, no plan ever survives contact with reality. We loaded ourselves up with the fresh gear that Mike brought, and set out to rescue the princess.
